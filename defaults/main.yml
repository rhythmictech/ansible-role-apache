# The below dict can be used in other roles that place SSL-enabled virtualhosts
#  for ease of configuring common SSL protocol/cipher combinations
#  You would use it in your virtualhost directive like so:
#
#  SSLProtocol: {{ apache_default_tls_lists.med.sslprotocol }}
#  SSLCipherSuite: {{ apache_default_tls_lists.med.sslciphersuite }}

# TLS levels derived from https://medium.com/@davetempleton/tls-configuration-cipher-suites-and-protocols-a01ee7005778
# low is super-compatible but enables weaker ciphers to support IE8/XP. Should be avoided, particularly with SNI
# med is conservative, widely compatible, and secure. meets BOD18-01
# high is very secure and compatible with anything modern. should be used whenever possible
# veryhigh prefers 256 bit ciphers and hashes, but will have a performance penalty for little security benefit
